# Dome_Controller

The controller housing consists of 6 "IR Pentagon Panel" panels, 10 "IR Hexagon Panel" panels, and 5 "IR Half Hexagon Panels". Panels mate via slots and buiscuits. Each panel is equiped with an ifrared sensor, and corresponding Neopixel. The entierety of the controller sits on a rotary encoder.

When up and running, the Ir sensors trigger its corresponding neopixel, and sends OSC information. This code is known to run on an Adafruit Feather M0 with the ATWink1500. 

Included are; componant stls, as well as Creality CR10 gcode for tabs, single panels, and sets of panels. (e.g. "... x1, ...x3"), Adobe Illustrator files for laser cutting a base, and arduino code.
